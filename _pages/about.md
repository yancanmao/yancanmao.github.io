About me
======

I am currently a System Engineer and Researcher at ByteDance Singapore, where I focus on developing AI Infrastructure Ray for large-scale distributed machine learning workloads.
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS), where I concentrated on cloud-native data systems and stream processing technologies. 
I completed my PhD at NUS under the supervision of  [Dr. Richard T. B. Ma](https://richard-ma.netlify.app/). 

I actively collaborate with [Dr. Shuhao Zhang](https://shuhaozhangtony.github.io/) on innovative research in streaming systems and related topics.

My primary research interests include heterogeneous ML workloads orchestration, distributed stream processing, and configuration optimization. 
I am deeply involved in the Apache Flink ecosystem, implementing novel research ideas to address challenges in large-scale data processing and streaming systems.
